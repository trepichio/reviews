# Reviewers

## About <a name = "about"></a>

It's a simple vanilla JS project. There is a card that show us a profile info about a reviewer and you can navigate among a list of them by clicking its *arrow* buttons and even get a random selection by clicking *Surprise Me* button.

Data is obtained from a JSON file through a fake API server and saved in memory for manipulation.

You can use the fake API server by installing `json-server` npm package globally:

```bash
npm install -g json-server
```

and then, run it at  project's root path:

```bash
json-server --watch db.json
```

So, the fake API will be served at: `http://localhost:3000/reviewers`

This little project is part of my goal to build 40 vanilla JS Projects.
Just that!
